The second chapter of this class deals with systems of linear equations.
Most exercises can be solved with the direct and iterative methods coded
in Python, inside the specific folder.

The available algorithms are:
 * Gaussian elimination w/ backward substitution and optional partial pivoting
 * tridiagonal matrix algorithm (Thomas algorithm)
 * Jacobi method
 * successive over-relaxation (or Gauss-Seidel, if Ï‰ = 1)
