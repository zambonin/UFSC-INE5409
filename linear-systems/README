The assignment consists of solving a system of `n` linear equations,
where n = 100, of the form

    x_{i} + x_{i+1} = 1.5,                          i = 1
    x_{i-1} + 3x_{i} + x_{i+1} + x_{i + n/2} = 1,   i = 2, ..., n/2
    x_{i - n/2} + x_{i-1} + 3x_{i} + x_{i+1} = 2,   i = n/2, ..., n-1
    x_{i-1} + x_{i} = 3,                            i = n

with naive Gaussian elimination and successive over-relaxation methods.
